![definitely not a meme.](https://github.com/nekowabo/nanolook/assets/150674202/8e27ff00-5f8a-44ba-971b-432fc336096f)
_Random photo from my demos opened in nanolook._

Made it just for fun in windows notepad and compiled using built-in windows csc.  
This is a photo viewer with as little code as possible in C#(not sure).  
Written in C#, the source code weighs 293 bytes. Compressed as hell.   

### You can download compiled program from releases.  

### How to use:
- Drag'n'Drop file into the program.
- From cmd => nanolook.exe [PATH/TO/FILE].
- As you wish.
  
### YOU CAN'T OPEN A PHOTO IN THE PROGRAM ITSELF!!!(it crashes lol)

### Has such functions as:
- Opens photos (incredible)!!!
- Shows file path and resolution of photo.

### Pros:
- OPENS PHOTOS OMG.
- Small as f*ck.

### Cons:
- Doesn't has all functions that other have.
- You can't open a photo in the program itself.
- Not recommended as permanent.

### History:
0.1 - ~800 bytes i don't remember  
0.2 - ~450 bytes  
1.0 - 349 bytes  
1.1 - 293 bytes
